    "# Emojify! \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is going to use word vector representations to build an Emojifier. \n",
    "🤩 💫 🔥\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wanted to make your text messages more expressive? Your emojifier app will help you do that. \n",
    "Rather than writing:\n",
    ">\"Congratulations on the promotion! Let's get coffee and talk. Love you!\"   \n",
    "\n",
    "The emojifier can automatically turn this into:\n",
    ">\"Congratulations on the promotion! 👍  Let's get coffee and talk. ☕️ Love you! ❤️\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as \"Let's go see the baseball game tonight!\") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (⚾️).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Word Vectors to Improve Emoji Lookups\n",
    "* In many emoji interfaces, you need to remember that ❤️  is the \"heart\" symbol rather than the \"love\" symbol. \n",
    "    * In other words, you'll have to remember to type \"heart\" to find the desired emoji, and typing \"love\" won't bring up that symbol.\n",
    "* You can make a more flexible emoji interface by using word vectors!\n",
    "* When using word vectors, you'll see that even if your training set explicitly relates only a few words to a particular emoji, your algorithm will be able to generalize and associate additional words in the test set to the same emoji.\n",
    "    * This works even if those additional words don't even appear in the training set. \n",
    "    * This allows you to build an accurate classifier mapping from sentences to emojis, even using a small training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What we'll build:\n",
    "1. In this exercise, we'll start with a baseline model (Emojifier-V1) using word embeddings.\n",
    "2. Then we will build a more sophisticated model (Emojifier-V2) that further incorporates an LSTM. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Project objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create an embedding layer in Keras with pre-trained word vectors\n",
    "* Explain the advantages and disadvantages of the GloVe algorithm\n",
    "* Describe how negative sampling learns word vectors more efficiently than other methods\n",
    "* Build a sentiment classifier using word embeddings\n",
    "* Build and train a more sophisticated classifier using an LSTM\n",

    "### 2.2 Keras and Mini-batching \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we want to train the LSTM model using mini-batches. However, most deep learning frameworks require that all sequences in the same mini-batch have the **same length**. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is what allows vectorization to work: If we had a 3-word sentence and a 4-word sentence, then the computations needed for them are different (one takes 3 steps of an LSTM, one takes 4 steps) so it's just not possible to do them both at the same time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Padding Handles Sequences of Varying Length\n",
    "* The common solution to handling sequences of **different length** is to use padding.  Specifically:\n",
    "    * Set a maximum sequence length\n",
    "    * Pad all sequences to have the same length. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Example of Padding:\n",
    "* Given a maximum sequence length of 20, we could pad every sentence with \"0\"s so that each input sentence is of length 20. \n",
    "* Thus, the sentence \"I love you\" would be represented as $(e_{I}, e_{love}, e_{you}, \\vec{0}, \\vec{0}, \\ldots, \\vec{0})$. \n",
    "* In this example, any sentences longer than 20 words would have to be truncated. \n",
    "* One way to choose the maximum sequence length is to just pick the length of the longest sentence in the training set. "
